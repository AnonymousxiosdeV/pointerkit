## About
PointerKit is a proof of concept framework to use a pointing device on iOS. This is done via a multipeer connection between a Mac and an iOS device. The pointer movement is captured by the Mac app, after which it's send to the receiving iOS device (over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi).

This project uses [PTFakeTouch](https://github.com/PugaTang/PTFakeTouch) for faking touches.
